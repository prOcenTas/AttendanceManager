# AttendanceManager
This app’s purpose is to make checking in attendance easier. Most of the schools and higher education faculties use Excel as a way to mark their student’s attendance, which is time-consuming and takes too much work. So what if we have an app that lets one by pressing one button check in a student only by requiring their studentId? By the help of the managers or admins of the software, You will be able to register new teachers, which protects the app from unwanted users. To add to that managers will be able to add students to the selected course, you might be asking why only managers? Well the answer is simple: it is not teachers that control the numbers of the class, it's the higher department. On the other hand, teachers are able to select their course and input the studentId whenever he or she wants to check him in.
